> Give something in order to help achieve or provide something

Therefore, there are four ways you can contribute to this project:
 * [Help Others](#help-others)
 * [Analyze Issues](#analyze-issues)
 * [Report an Issue](#report-an-issue)
 * [Contribute Code](#contribute-code)

## Help Others

You can help this project by helping others who use it and need answers. You will find questions on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions). There is no official tag for this project yet. If you have the power to create one, feel free to do so and let us know.

## Analyze Issues

Analyzing issue reports can be a lot of effort. Any help is welcome!
Go to [the Github issue tracker](../../issues) and find an open issue that needs assistance.

## Report an Issue

If you find a defect or you have an idea for improvement you are welcome to report it.
We can only handle well-reported, actual defects, so please follow the guidelines below and use [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tag-name) for support questions. When in doubt, check StackOverflow to determine whether the issue is an actual defect.

When you're sure the issue is a viable defect, go to [the Github issue tracker](../../issues) and file a defect report.

### Quick Checklist for Defects Reports

Issue report checklist:
 - Real, current bug
 - No duplicates
 - Reproducible
 - Good summary
 - Well-documented
 - Minimal example provided
 - Issue handling process exhausted

### Issue handling process

When you report an issue, a committer will either follow up on a resolution, ask for more details, or close the ticket if the issue is not valid. Issue reports will be properly commented for your verification.

### Reporting Security Issues
If you find a security issue, please act responsibly and report it directly to YaaS, instead of the public issue tracker.

To report a security issue: 
1. Go to https://devportal.yaas.io/.
2. Click a feedback button, link, or icon.
3. Enter all details concerning the issue.
4. Click **Submit**.

### Issue Reporting Disclaimer

We want to improve the quality of this project and good bug reports are welcome! But because capacity is limited, we cannot handle questions or consultation requests and cannot always probe for required details not provided in the feedback. We reserve the right to close or not process insufficient defect reports in favor of cleanly documented and reproducible issues. Even though we would like to solve each well-documented issue, there is always the chance that it won't happen. Remember, this is an open source project and it comes without a warranty.

## Contribute Code

You are welcome to contribute code to this project in order to fix bugs or to implement new features.

There are three important things to know:

* Be aware of the Apache License, which describes contributions, and **agree to the Contributors License Agreement**. This is common practice in all major Open Source projects. To make this process as simple as possible, we are using *[CLA assistant](https://cla-assistant.io/)* for individual contributions. CLA assistant is an open source tool that integrates well with GitHub and enables a one-click experience for accepting the CLA. For company contributers special rules apply. See the respective section below for details.
* There are **several requirements regarding code style, quality, and product standards** which need to be met.
* Not all proposed contributions can be accepted. The code must fit the overall direction of, and verifiably improve, the project. While most bug fixes are improvements, major feature implementations must be discussed with one of the projects committers (the top 20 or so users in the [Contributors List](/graphs/contributors)), preferably someone who recently touched the related code. The more effort you invest in your contribution, the more reason there is to clarify in advance whether the contribution fits the criteria. The best path is to open an enhancement ticket in the issue tracker to discuss the feature you plan to implement, making it clear you intend to contribute. We will then forward the proposal to the respective code owner. This process is intended to avoid unused work and disappointment.

### Contributor License Agreement

When you contribute code, documentation, or anything else, be aware that your contribution is covered by the same [Apache 2.0 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) that is applied to this project. In particular, you must agree to the Individual Contributor License Agreement, which can be [found here](https://gist.github.com/CLAassistant/bd1ea8ec8aa0357414e8). This applies to all contributors, including those contributing on behalf of a company. If you agree to its content, click on the link posted by the CLA assistant as a comment to the pull request. Click it to check the CLA, then accept it on the following screen if you agree. The CLA assistant saves this decision for upcoming contributions and will notify you if there is any change to the CLA in the meantime.

### Contribution Process

To contribute an improvement to this project:

1. Make sure the change is valid and warranted by proposing it in a GitHub issue.
2. When you receive approval for your proposal, fork the project and create a new branch.
3. Commit and push your changes on your new branch. In the commit messages, specify what you changed and provide the GitHub issue number you initially created to propose the change.
4. Create a Pull Request from the origin repository to the master branch.
5. Follow the link posted by the CLA assistant to your pull request and accept it.
6. Wait for YaaS code review and approval. The approver may request enhancements to your change.
7. When the change is approved, you will receive a notification in a comment.
8. YaaS will close the pull request. You can then remove the obsolete branch from your fork.
