# Readme Requirements
--

## Overview

The README of your repository should start with two elements:
- Badges (Optional)
- Description

### Badges (Optional)

Depending on the technology used for your project, you can use different badges. Badges are a good way of sharing important information with your users, like:
- Status of CI build plans
- Number of downloads
- Dependencies
- Test coverage

There are different providers of badges. Choose badges wisely and one-by-one:
- VersionEye
- https://badge.fury.io/
- http://shields.io/
- https://david-dm.org/

### Description

A detailed description of the project is a must-have element. 

## Table of Contents

Make it easier for your project users and provide an easy-to-use table of contents (list of links) to navigate through the README document.

```
* [Installation](#installation)
* [Usage](#usage)
* [Development](#development)
* [License](#license)
* [Defects and Feedback](#defects-and-feedback)
* [Contribution](#contribution)
* [Credits](#credits)
```
## Installation

Explain the steps to install your project. For example:
* If it is a node module, explain how to install it with NPM and what scripts to trigger to make it work.
* If it is a Java lib, explain the maven dependencies and any configuration to perform to include the dependencies in the project.

## Usage

This is the most important section, with a lot of subsections or documentation links.
Explain how to use the project. Include the instructions and documentation or provide a link.

## Development

Add instructions on how to develop the project. It must be clear what to do, and how to trigger tests. Other contributors need to know how to make sure that their pull requests will be accepted.

## License

Include a license description and a link to the license file. The file name must be `LICENSE`. The Apache 2.0 license file is located in this repository so you can copy it to your repository: [LICENSE](LICENSE).

This is the description that you should place in the License section:
```
Copyright (c) 2014 [SAP SE](http://www.sap.com) or an SAP affiliate company. All rights reserved.

Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");
you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

```
## Defects and Feedback

Explain exactly how to provide feedback and report defects for the project:
```
Read the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) so you know exactly how to report defects or feedback properly using the [the Github issue tracker](../../issues)
```

## Contribution

Provide info and a link to the file explaining the contribution rules. The filename must be `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Define the rules for your project and describe:
- When and how report an issue (this is also a contribution)
- How to create a Pull Request, and what it should contain
- What are the rules you follow during the review

The CONTRIBUTING.md file is located in this repository so you can copy it to your repository: [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md)

```
Read the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) so you know exactly how to contribute to this project.
```

### StackOverflow Link

Yes, for open source projects we need to use tools that the open source community is using.
Update the links to StackOverflow in the `CONTRIBUTING` file, pointing users to the proper `tag` for your project, if it exists. You need to be a respected StackOverflow user to create tags on your own.

## Credits

Share who is the main contributor, and who gives the most support to provide the project.
